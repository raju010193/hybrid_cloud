Getting Familiar with your JSP server
If you do not have a JSP capable web-server or application server, the first step is to download one.  There are many such servers available, most of which can be downloaded for free evaluation and/or development.  Some of them are:

    Blazix from Desiderata Software (1.5 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
    TomCat from Apache (Approx 6 Megabytes)
    WebLogic from BEA Systems (Approx 40 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
    WebSphere from IBM (Approx 100 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)

To take the best advantage of this tutorial, it recommended that all the material should be tried out with a real server.  

Once you have a JSP capable web-server or application server, you need to know the following information about it:

    Where to place the files
    How to access the files from your browser (with an http: prefix, not as file:)

You should be able to create a simple file, such as

    <HTML>
    <BODY>
    Hello, world
    </BODY>
    </HTML>

know where to place this file and how to see it in your browser with an http:// prefix.

Since this step is different for each web-server, you would need to see the web-server documentation to find out how this is done.  Once you have completed this step, proceed to the next tutorial.
