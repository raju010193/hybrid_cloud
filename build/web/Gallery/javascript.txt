JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and first appeared in Netscape Navigator (a no longer existing web browser) in1995. First it was called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

The JavaScript standard was adopted by the industry standard association ECMA in 1997.

The standard (called ECMAScript-262) was approved as an international ISO standard in 1998.

The development of ECMAScript is still in process.
